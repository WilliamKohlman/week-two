# Week Two Journal
 
## Readings

Unfortunately my time was also limited this week due to having to fill in for another driver at my delivery job since they got a full time job welding. This meant that I only had time to read the articles quickly. A strange quirk was that it may have just been how I accessed the pdfs, but I did not see any hypothesis annotations, which disappointed me as I looked forward to seeing what my classmates thought on the subject.

### [National Library of Scotland Tweet Thread](https://twitter.com/natlibscot/status/1255478042207621126)

I found this thread to be very insightful into the whole process for museums or archives / other similar organizations to make things fully accessible online. It puts into perspective how its not as simple as just scanning/photographing something and uploading it into a gallery on the web. There is a lot of data required for a full digitisation. The transparency about these efforts is something that all museums/archives/others should aim for in my opinion as it lets the public see the work that goes into everything.

#### Story Time

I have some first hand knowledge of the amount of effort required to digitize the contents of archives. I took the Co-op option for my History degree so that I would be able to get work experience while in school. This resulted in my 2nd placement, which was from May-August 2019, being at the Library and Archives Canada in the ATIP division for Personnel Records and Archival Operations Records teams as a Junior ATIP Registration Officer. During my co-op, I attended various training/seminars that expanded on the importance of metadata, safe handling of materials, etc. This culminated in a tour of the Gatineau Preservation Centre. While there we toured the various areas and were shown the rooms where they scanned all of the various WW1 Personnel Records so that they could upload them to the [web](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/first-world-war/personnel-records/Pages/search.aspx). After working with some of the archival material, and personnel records, I began to understand how much of our history is just sitting in warehouses/vaults. Because of my experiences here, I saw how we can use our history, such as providing personnel records for people to help them with scholarships, licence plates, or admission into old age homes, etc. and how important the stewards of the information are. My time spent here made me believe that we should work with our history to not only record history, but to use it to help people in the present.

### [Transcription maximized; expense minimized? Crowdsourcing and editing The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/2/119.abstract)

I had first learned of the crowd-sourced Transcribe Bentham project in my 2nd year Digital Humanities course, so this was a nice reminder and refresher on the subject.

I found the sheer amount of transciptions to be awe-inspiring. This massive community effort is really touching and an example of what Digital History can be.

Something that I had not known about the project before was how the Transcription Desk had been updated to make it more usable and allow for faster transcriptions. This aspect of it shows how important the underlying technology is in Digital Humanities, and that how some  limits are not ourselves, but how we interact with the digital environments. I found the lengths they went to to ensure they were as accurate as they could be interesting. I did not know how rigourous the process was for the volunteers.

This article did a really good job at showing how community driven/sourced projects can succeed. These kinds of projects need plnaning, direction, clear goals, ability to consider and implement feedback on the fly. I really enjoy how it shows just how good community driven digital history projects can be, if done properly. It makes me excited for the future of Digital History projects.

I thought the discussion surrounding using the transcriptions as a tool to train HTR models to be really interesting and connected to the end of our instructions for OCR how handwriting OCR can be difficult to automate.

## wget, APIs, OCR

I really enjoyed following along with these modules since I have a basic knowledge of coding so I was able to understand the logic and flow of everything. While I could follow it, I don't know this stuff on my own so I couldn't do it on my own yet(without fear of breaking/downloading the whole internet anyways), but I do want to improve my coding skills and knowledge since I always enjoyed coding.

I wanted to expand on my knoweldge with the bonuses, and tweaking the code to mess around with other APIs but unfortunately did not have the time. I know I said this before, but I do really want to find time to go back and explore the bonuses to expand my horizons. 

These tools showed me how I can amateurly work with the existing digital means to do some of my own analysis and exploration. I enjoy some of this "dirty" work of transcribing/transforming material because there is an obvious before and after in the work. Looking ahead in the course I see next week's work expands on what we learned this week so that should be interesting. 



## Reflections

Seeing the "Funding" heading in the two academic articles did make me consider who/what is paying for work to be done, and for things to exist online. For example, the authors only being able to publish their article on their own site due to a loophole was really eye-opening into how much work may be out there but not accessible to the public. I never really considered this before since through Carleton I have access to a lot of academic resoruces that many other people do not. I don't think about it often, but I realized it the other day when I was asked to use my Carleton accounts/access to do some research for my day job since I am able to get into databases that are usually paywalled. 

While Carleton provides access to these sites, I don't feel that they do a great job of explaining how to access them or how to navigate the site. If it wasn't for my FYSM History class, I would've been exploring the library site on my own, which would have hindered my ability to find things later in my degree. While Carleton does their best to make things accessible for us students, they are beholden to the sites that actually host the content. This means that if a site is not optimized for people, they may be unable to read/explore things due to some weird hardware/software glitch.

As a student, I think for the most part I fit in as a cog in the digital history machine. For now, the roles available to me are most likely entry level, which requires doing the hard dirty work of data transformation and cleaning. This is not necesarrily a bad thing as this work is essential to the work being done, but I feel that sometimes it can be overwhelming for people. For me, as someone who isn't actively participating in the digital history machine, I feel that my amateur work can be best used to help future students, and then to also help support existing projects, whether it be through monetary means or emotional support, or even helping with some of the work if I was so inclined. 


## Overall Reflections

As mentioned earlier, I was fairly busy this week as well which was disappointing because these tools we learned this week I find fascinating and I want to improve my skills with them as they seem fairly straightforward at this point.

While I was not able to sit and dedicate large amounts of time this week, I was able to use my bad habit of constantly checking discord to help assist other people with their problems this week. I was able to do this from paying attention to other problems/solutions posted in discord, as well as through some of my own trial and error. This felt good as I was able to help some people solve their problems before they got overwhelmed by them. 

I am still working on doing a better job documenting the nitty gritty reality of the work I'm doing and taking notes of everything I've done as I tend to push through things on my own, and come away with only the final copy. I believe I've done a better job this week of taking notes of my processes, but I am continuing to work on it.
